==About Dosbox 0.74==
DOSBox is emulator software that emulates (loosely: "simulates") an IBM PC compatible computer running the older operating system, MS-DOS. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original MS-DOS programs are provided an environment in which they can run correctly on many modern computers running a variety of operating systems. DOSBox is especially intended for use with old PC games. DOSBox is free software written primarily in C++ and distributed under the GNU General Public License.
