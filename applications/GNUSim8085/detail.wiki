==About GNUSim8085 1.3.7==
GNUSim8085 is a graphical simulator, assembler and debugger for the Intel 8085 microprocessor in GNU/Linux and Windows. It is among the 20 winners of the FOSS India Awards announced on February, 2008. GNUSim8085 was originally written by Sridhar Ratnakumar in fall 2003 when he realized that no proper simulators existed for Linux. Several patches, bug fixes and software packaging have been contributed by the GNUSim8085 community. GNUSim8085 users are encouraged to contribute to the simulator through coding, documenting, testing, translating and porting the simulator

==Features of GNUSim8085 1.3.7==
# Editor
    Program editor with interactive input wizard for all the standard instructions
    Syntax highlighting in editor to distinguish between instructions, operands, comments etc.
    A separate opcode view which displays assembled code in hex
# Assembler
    Support for all standard instructions of the 8085
    Minimalistic support for three assembler directives (.equ, .db, .ds) to control data locations, there exist no directives to directly control code locations
    Code start is defined outside source code ("load me at" entry) - if not defined (default), code is generated (strangely) from 4200h (instead from the real reset vector 0000h)
    Assembly results can be stored as listing file only (no binary file output)
# Debugger
    Complete view of registers and flags
    Support for breakpoints
    Step by step execution/debugging of program
    Hex / Decimal Converter
    Runtime inspection of stack and source code variables defined
    Runtime inspection and manipulation of memory and I/O ports
# Printing
    Printing of program from editor as well as assembled hex code (known not to work well in Windows)
