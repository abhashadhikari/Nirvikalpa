==About Guido van Robot 4.4==
Guido van Robot, or GvR for short, is a programming language and free software application designed to introduce beginners to the fundamentals of programming. GvR runs on Windows, Macintosh, and GNU/Linux, in a variety of languages! It's great in both the classroom and the home as a way of introducing people to the basic concepts of programming.

==Features of Guido van Robot 4.4==
# Guido van Robot is a minimalistic programming language providing just enough syntax to help students learn the concepts of sequencing, conditional branching, looping and procedural abstraction. 
# Block Structuring: Each Guido van Robot instruction must be on a separate line. A sequence of one or more Guido van Robot instructions that are all indented the same number of spaces compose a block of code.   
# Conditional branching refers to the ability of a program to alter it's flow of execution based on the result of the evaluation of a conditional. The three types of conditional branching instructions in Guido van Robot are if and if/else and if/elif/else. 
# Conditionals: GvR has eighteen built-in tests that are divided into three groups: the first six are wall tests, the next four are beeper tests, and the last eight are compass tests.
# Iteration refers to the ability of a program to repeate an instruction (or block of instructions) over and over until some condition is met. The two types of iteration instructions are the do and while instructions.
