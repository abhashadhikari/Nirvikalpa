==About i8086emu 0.9.2==
i8086emu is an cross-platform emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor. It has support for dynamically loadable device plugins and some peripherals like a PIT, PIC, 8-segment-displays, buttons and leds. i8086emu comes with an ncurses and an GTK-2 gui.
It is basically designed for emulating a Single Board Computer 86 (SBC86) which is used in our microprocessor faculty. For this reason it consists of the original ROM of the SBC86 which is a whole debug-software with extra trace and step functionality.
This piece of software is published under the GPL and therefore marked as open source.
